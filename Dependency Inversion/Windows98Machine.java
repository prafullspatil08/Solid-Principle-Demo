// To demonstrate this, let’s go old-school and bring to life a Windows 98 computer with code:

public class Windows98Machine {}

// But what good is a computer without a monitor and keyboard? 
// Let’s add one of each to our constructor so that every Windows98Computer we instantiate comes prepacked with a Monitor and a StandardKeyboard:

public class Windows98Machine {

    private final StandardKeyboard keyboard;
    private final Monitor monitor;

    public Windows98Machine() {
        monitor = new Monitor();
        keyboard = new StandardKeyboard();
    }

}

// This code will work, and we’ll be able to use the StandardKeyboard and Monitor freely within our Windows98Computer class.

// Problem solved? Not quite. By declaring the StandardKeyboard and Monitor with the new keyword, we’ve tightly coupled these three classes together.

// Not only does this make our Windows98Computer hard to test, 
// but we’ve also lost the ability to switch out our StandardKeyboard class with a different one should the need arise. And we’re stuck with our Monitor class too.

// Let’s decouple our machine from the StandardKeyboard by adding a more general Keyboard interface and using this in our class:

public interface Keyboard { }

public class Windows98Machine{

    private final Keyboard keyboard;
    private final Monitor monitor;

    public Windows98Machine(Keyboard keyboard, Monitor monitor) {
        this.keyboard = keyboard;
        this.monitor = monitor;
    }
}

// Here, we’re using the dependency injection pattern to facilitate adding the Keyboard dependency into the Windows98Machine class.

// Let’s also modify our StandardKeyboard class to implement the Keyboard interface so that it’s suitable for injecting into the Windows98Machine class:

public class StandardKeyboard implements Keyboard { }

// Now our classes are decoupled and communicate through the Keyboard abstraction. 
// If we want, we can easily switch out the type of keyboard in our machine with a different implementation of the interface. We can follow the same principle for the Monitor class.

// Excellent! We’ve decoupled the dependencies and are free to test our Windows98Machine with whichever testing framework we choose.
