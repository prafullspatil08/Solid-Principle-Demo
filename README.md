Welcome to your comprehensive guide to the SOLID principles of object-oriented design!

This guide covers:

Overview of each SOLID principle
Benefits of applying the principles
Code examples in Java
Strategies for fixing code that violates the principles
### The 5 SOLID Principles

#### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Introduction: A class should have only one reason to change.
Benefits: Focused classes, easier to maintain, test, and reuse.
Code Examples:
Book class with text-related methods
BookPrinter class for printing text
Solutions: Refactor classes with multiple responsibilities.
#### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Introduction: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Benefits: Add functionality without breaking existing code.
Code Examples:
Guitar class extended to SuperCoolGuitarWithFlames
Solutions: Use inheritance or composition to extend functionality.
#### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Introduction: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
Benefits: Consistent behavior, reliable code.
Code Examples:
Car interface and MotorCar/ElectricCar implementations
Solutions: Rework models to account for subtype differences.
#### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Introduction: Large interfaces should be split into smaller ones.
Benefits: Flexibility, classes implement only necessary methods.
Code Examples:
BearKeeper interface split into BearCleaner, BearFeeder, BearPetter
Solutions: Identify and separate distinct interface responsibilities.
#### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Introduction: High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not low-level modules.
Benefits: Decoupled code, easier to test and maintain.
Code Examples:
Windows98Machine with Keyboard interface and dependency injection
Solutions: Introduce abstractions and use dependency injection.
